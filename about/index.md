# about ...

## me

I am dealing with data analysis, and therefore I use and create *[code](/code)*.
Sometimes I write a *[blog](/blog)* post about problems solved by coding.
A lot of those solutions I apply at my workplace at the
*[Bioinformatics Core Facility][agebit]{:target="_blank"}* of the
*Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing*, Cologne, Germany.

## my languages

My most advanced language is *[R][r]{:target="_blank"}* and recently I started
learning *[Julia][jl]{:target="_blank"}*.
Of course there are many others used frequently (e.g. bash and python).

## science

I worked in scientific projects and gained experience about plant physiology,
population genetics, agricultural research, genome wide association studies,
high throughput RNA sequencing, analysis of differential gene expression and
other methods. Find articles I contributed to at my research gate
*[profile][rgate]*.
