# about ...

Welcome to my homepage!

Here you will find an introduction about myself, and some links to sources 
where you can find out what I am interested in.

## me

My career started with *Audi*, where I trained and worked as 
**Industrial Mechanic**, maintaining the production of an older A3 model - 
*Vorsprung durch Technik*.

Being interested in the mechanics of also living things, I decided to advance
my knowledge, and studied to become a **Biologist**.
These were also the years, where I started to be a **Linux enthusiast**.

Fascinated about life science, I became a **PhD student**, studying an important
crop plant - barley (the one related to *whiskey* and *beer*). During this great project, I learned a lot about *statistical analysis*,
*programming* and *computational biology*.

To improve my skills in *data science* and *human genetics*, I took a job as
**Programmer & Data Analyst** at a bioinformatics core facility of a renowned
research institute. Nimbly handling of *big data* on *high performance compute
clusters* is my daily joy. With this tools, I can provide excellent *biostatistical
analysis and consulting* for state of the art research.

## technologies

* I prefer to engineer software in the languages

    * **[Julia][jl]{:target="_blank"}** - a modern language for statistical computing
    * **[R][r]{:target="_blank"}** - a statistical computing language
    * **[C++][cpp]{:target="_blank"}** - a general purpose programming language
    * **[Python][py]{:target="_blank"}** - an interpreted programming and scripting language
    * **[bash][bash]{:target="_blank"}** - shell programming

* The fields of statistical analysis I am competent and interested in are

    * **Linear Models** - estimate and predict effects
    * **Multivariate Analysis** - find patterns in data
    * **Genetical Statistics** - analyse genetic data (from sequencing to population genetics)
    * **Machine Learning** - learn from data, predict the future
    
* IT Systems I prefer and am trained to use are

	* **Linux Servers** - from web-, database-, compute- to multimedia workstations
    * **Mac OS Systems** - great and easy to use platform to connect to IT infrastructure

## further information

Find me at twitter (**[@setempler][twt]**), follow my **[blog](/blog)**, or read about my
**[research][rgate]**.

Parts of software engineering and documentation I am involved with, can be seen on this site's
sections **[Code](/code)** and **[Manuals](/manuals)**, or on my **[github][hub]** profile.

Interested in my profile? I am always looking forward to meet nice people and get inspired by new
discoveries and technologies - please do not hesitate to contact me!
