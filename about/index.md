# about ...

Welcome to my homepage!

Maybe you are interested about what you can find here and about my person - so keep on reading!


## an introduction to myself

I am trained as **Biologist**, and **industrial mechanic** in the traditional sence (university degree and apprenticeship, respectively).
After working in the car manufacturing industry (with Audi - you know *Vorsprung durch Technik*? Or at least the four rings ...), I decided to get to know more about life, so I studied Biology.

Next step was a **PhD research project** - very common for Biologists.
This I did in the field of agricultural science, to investigate food security in terms of sustainable production.
One great thing about it, was that I was working on barley - the crop which is famous for it's use in whiskey and beer production.
At this position, I learned a lot about **statistics** and **data analysis**.
And even more, that I very much like **engineering software**.

After that, I started a job as a **programmer** & **data analyst** in bioinformatics at a service unit of the Max Planck Society.
Here I could apply a lot of my knowledge about writing software for analysis of data, helping
scientists to unravel the mysteries of the biology of ageing - and to deal with **big data**.
Working on large **computing cluster** systems, as well as administrating software platforms as a service (PaaS) also got me into managing **Linux** systems.

This is my *curriculum vitae* for now - what's up in the future? I am always looking for new and exciting tasks to develop my skills!
