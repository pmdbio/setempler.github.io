# about

## ... me

I am dealing with data analysis, and therefore I use and create **[code](/code)**.
Sometimes I write a **[blog](/blog)** post about problems solved by coding.
A lot of those solutions I apply at my workplace at the 
[Bioinformatics Core Group][agebit]{:target="_blank"} of the *Max Planck Institute
for Biology of Ageing*, Cologne, Germany.

## ... my languages

My most advanced language is [R][r]{:target="_blank"} and recently I started learning 
[Julia][jl]{:target="_blank"}.
Of course there are many others used frequently (e.g. bash and python).
