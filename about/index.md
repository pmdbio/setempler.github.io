Welcome to my homepage!

Here you will find an introduction about myself, and some links to sources 
where you can find out what I am interested in.

## me

* Career started at *Audi AG* as **Industrial Mechanic** - *Vorsprung durch Technik*.
* Studying **Biology** at *Wuerzburg University* and becoming a **Linux enthusiast**.
* Studying *barley* to improve products among *whiskey* and *beer* (: at the
    *Max Planch Institute for Plant Breeding Research, Cologne* and becoming skilled in
    **Statistics** and **Programming**.
* Consulting and acting as **Data Analyst** in the area of **Bioinformatics** at the
    *Max Planch Institute for Biology of Ageing, Cologne*.

## technologies

I prefer to engineer software in the languages

* **[Julia][jl]{:target="_blank"}** - a modern language for statistical computing
* **[R][r]{:target="_blank"}** - a statistical computing language
* **[C++][cpp]{:target="_blank"}** - a general purpose programming language
* **[Python][py]{:target="_blank"}** - an interpreted programming and scripting language
* **[bash][bash]{:target="_blank"}** - shell programming

The fields of statistical analysis I am competent and interested in are

* **Linear Models** - estimate and predict effects
* **Multivariate Analysis** - find patterns in data
* **Genetical Statistics** - analyse genetic data (from sequencing to population genetics)
* **Machine Learning** - learn from data, predict the future

IT Systems I like and am trained to use are

* **Linux Servers** - from web-, database-, compute- to multimedia workstations
* **Mac OS Systems** - great and easy to use platform to connect to IT infrastructure

## further information

Find me at twitter (**[@setempler][twt]**), follow my **[blog](/blog)**, or read about my
**[research][scholar]**.

Parts of software engineering and documentation I am involved with, can be seen on this site's
sections **[Code](/code)** and **[Manuals](/manuals)**, or on my **[github][hub]** profile.

Interested in my profile? I am always looking forward to meet nice people and get inspired by new
