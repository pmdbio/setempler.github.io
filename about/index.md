# {about}

Welcome to my homepage!

## story

My name is Sven, and I am enthusiastic about technology, science and live.

I was trained in a lot of different areas (e.g. manufacturing, research, sales).
For example, my career started at *Audi*, where I got trained and worked as **Industrial Mechanic**.
I went on studying at the beautiful town of Würzburg to become a **Biologist**.
During that time, I worked in sales and consulting for a local **Orchid Care** company.
Moving on to the city of Köln (Cologne) to start a PhD in agricultural science
at a *Max Planck Institute*, I got infected with **Statistics** and **Programming**.
To expand my knowledge in **Bioinformatics**, I started working in a research service facility
to support scientist discover the hidden features of the biology of ageing.
Now I apply all my expertise to develop applications specific for the technologies
of Germany's largest **Biotechnology** company *Miltenyi Biotec*.
